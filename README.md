# XmlStats

This plugin for the Bukkit Minecraft Server API ([Homepage](http://bukkig.org) | [Github](https://github.com/Bukkit/Bukkit )) offers the possibility to access some playerstats via xml files. The provided data is basically generated by [Stats](https://github.com/nidefawl/Stats).

## Usage

To install the plugin, simply place the compiled **XmlStats.jar** in your servers plugin directory and execute the /reload-command on your server. The plugin will create it's config file in the /plugins/XmlStats directory. To enable the webserver of the plugin you have to edit the config.yml, set the following value and reload the server again:
  
    options.webserver-enabled: true
    
Afterwards you can access the following xml files:

    http://server:port/users.xml for a list of all known players on your server.
    http://server:port/userstats.xml for the stats of all known players
    
The following commands are planned but not implemented yet:

    http://server:port/userstats.xml?id=username to fetch the stats of the given user
    http://server:port/money.xml to get data provided by the iConomy plugin
    http://server:port/money.xml?id=username self-explanatory
